## tripwire/integration_unittest.nim — `test:` / `suite:` wrapping the
## chosen unittest backend with tripwire's verifier lifecycle.
##
## Purpose
## -------
## Consumer tests call `tripwire.test "name":` and `tripwire.suite "name":`.
## Each tripwire `test:` body is wrapped (Defense 4 — try/finally lifecycle,
## per design §11) so that:
##   1. a fresh `Verifier` is pushed onto the thread-local stack on entry,
##   2. the body runs inside `try:` and, on normal completion, is checked
##      for pending async operations (Defense 6 — design §10),
##   3. `finally:` pops the verifier and calls `verifyAll`, which raises
##      `UnassertedInteractionsDefect` / `UnusedMocksDefect` if either
##      guarantee is violated.
##
## `verifyAllOnExit` is wired into the process via `addExitProc` the first
## time `test:` instantiates on a thread. It drains any verifier that was
## leaked across test boundaries (e.g. the body raised, the process is
## shutting down with the stack non-empty) and reports the leak on stderr
## rather than on the next test.
##
## Backend selection
## -----------------
## By default this module re-exports `std/unittest`. With
## `-d:tripwireUnittest2` it re-exports `unittest2` (see `unittest2`
## package on nimble). Both backends expose the same `suite` and `test`
## templates; our `test:` / `suite:` templates forward to whichever is
## active via the `backend` alias.
import std/exitprocs
import ./[sandbox, verify, errors, futures]

when defined(tripwireUnittest2):
  import unittest2 as backend
  const backendName* = "unittest2"
else:
  import std/unittest as backend
  const backendName* = "std/unittest"

# Re-export the backend EXCEPT its `test` and `suite` templates. Those
# are shadowed by tripwire's own `test`/`suite` wrappers below — if both
# were visible, consumers writing bare `suite "x":` / `test "y":` would
# hit an ambiguous-call error (seen under `-d:tripwireUnittest2`). The
# tripwire wrapper is the intended entry point; the backend's raw forms
# stay available as `backend.test` / `backend.suite` through the
# `backend` alias when callers need them (e.g., self-hosting tests).

  ##
  ## **First-violation-wins semantics** (matches `sandbox:` in
  ## `tripwire/sandbox.nim`): if the body raised, that defect IS the
  ## verification failure — pop the verifier but skip verifyAll so the
  ## original (more informative) defect isn't masked by a secondary
  ## UnassertedInteractionsDefect raised inside a `finally`.

  ## raw `suite` is intentionally excluded from the re-export to avoid
  ## ambiguity; callers that need the unwrapped form can reach it via
  ## the `backend` alias.
