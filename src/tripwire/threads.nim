## tripwire/threads.nim — Verifier-inheriting thread primitives.
##
## Public surface:
##   - `ThreadHandoff`      — heap-allocated handoff record (parent → child)
##   - `tripwireThread`     — low-level drop-in replacement for `createThread`
##   - `runWithVerifier`    — explicit-verifier-param escape hatch
##   - `withTripwireThread` — canonical ergonomic wrapper
##   - `childEntry`         — child-thread entry used by `withTripwireThread`

  ThreadHandoff* = ref object
    ## Heap-allocated handoff record crossed through createThread's data arg.

    ## after the parent's stack frame where it was constructed has progressed.
    verifier*: Verifier         ## ref Verifier — inherited parent state
    body*: proc() {.gcsafe.}    ## closure capturing the user body.
                                ## Intentionally `{.gcsafe.}` only (no `thread`
                                ## / `nimcall`): the closure is invoked from
                                ## inside `childEntry` (which is itself
                                ## `{.thread, nimcall, gcsafe.}`) rather than
                                ## being passed as a proc pointer to
                                ## `createThread`. The calling-convention
                                ## requirement applies to the entry proc, not
                                ## to nested closures.

  ## Low-level drop-in replacement for `createThread`. Argument order
  ## matches stdlib `createThread(t, fn, arg)` exactly so the substitution
  ## is mechanical. Caller retains ownership of `thr` and must call
  ## `joinThread(thr)` themselves.
  ##
  ## `fn` runs on the new thread; it receives `data` identically to
  ## `createThread`. `fn` MUST carry `{.thread, nimcall, gcsafe.}`; the
  ## `nimcall` calling convention matches stdlib and permits passing
  ## non-closure procs across threads.
  ##
  ## IMPORTANT: `fn` is responsible for pushing the parent verifier onto
  ## its verifierStack via `runWithVerifier`. If you want verifier
  ## inheritance at this level, wrap your body with `runWithVerifier`:
  ##
  ##    proc workerBody(data: MyData) {.thread, nimcall.} =
  ##      runWithVerifier(data.verifier):
  ##        realWork(data)

  ## `withTripwireThread` does this wrapping automatically.
  ##
  ## Raises `ResourceExhaustedError` if the OS cannot allocate a thread.

  ## is too restrictive — e.g., for thread-pool workers that receive a
  ## verifier through a channel.
  ##
  ## Invariant: on entry the current thread's verifierStack MUST be empty
  ## (otherwise raises NestedTripwireThreadDefect). On exit the stack is
  ## guaranteed empty again.

  ## Not intended for nested use within an already-sandboxed context on

  ## 4. parent awaits joinThread before returning control to caller
  ## 5. parent does NOT mutate the verifier while the child runs (design invariant)
  ## Exceptions raised in `body` propagate to the parent via `joinThread`.
